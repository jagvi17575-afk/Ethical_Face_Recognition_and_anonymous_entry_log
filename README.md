**Problem Statement:**
Some areas in schools should only be accessed by authorized staff. This project uses AI to recognize authorized faces while also explaining how privacy is protected.

I began by clearly understanding the problem statement and identifying:
• What the AI model needs to do, what kind of input it will receive, what output is expected,how the user will interact with the system. This step helped us think like problem solvers, not just
  coders.
• I trained image classification model.The model was designed to work with images in a
  specific format (RGB, resized to 224×224).
• I Created the User Interface with Streamlit and  build a simple web interface. 
• Users can capture images using the camera.
• The image is processed and sent to the ML model.The predicted result is displayed clearly on the screen.
  This helps  us understand how backend AI logic connects with frontend UI.
  While building the project, I focused on Ethical AI usage , Clear labeling of outputs , Avoiding misuse by limiting unnecessary data storage or over-explanation.
I also ensured AI tools like Gemini were used responsibly, only for controlled and informative responses.
• I integrated Google Gemini to enhance the project with intelligent responses ,learned how API keys work,understood why API keys must never be exposed publicly.

 
Before deploying,secured  Sensitive Information:
• Used .gitignore to hide sensitive files.
• Stored API keys safely .
• Pushed our project code to GitHub properly.
• Deploying the Project on Streamlit Cloud
• Connected our GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud.
• Added secrets securely on the cloud platform.
• Deployed the application successfully.
• Generated a live public URL that can be accessed from
anywhere.

**Tech Stack :--** Python , Streamlit , Google Teachable Machine and Google Gemini API were effictively used.
